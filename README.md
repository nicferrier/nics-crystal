# Crystal Lang

I am really quite excited about Crystal Lang. It's odd because I was
never into Ruby.

Where with Ruby is was *"What's the point? I've got Python"*, Crystal
is a different proposition because of it's nice compiler.

The types in Crystal disappear until it looks like Ruby. Which is a
nice enough language after all.

This code, therefore, is to help me use Crystal from Emacs, which is
obviously always the right thing to do.
